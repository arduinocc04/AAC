  abstract = {Two border following algorithms are proposed for the topological analysis of digitized binary images. The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used.}

  abstract = {The wide availability and popularity of text-based communication channels encourage the usage of ASCII art in representing images. Existing tone-based ASCII art generation methods lead to halftone-like results and require high text resolution for display, as higher text resolution offers more tone variety. This paper presents a novel method to generate structure-based ASCII art that is currently mostly created by hand. It approximates the major line structure of the reference image content with the shape of characters. Representing the unlimited image content with the extremely limited shapes and restrictive placement of characters makes this problem challenging. Most existing shape similarity metrics either fail to address the misalignment in real-world scenarios, or are unable to account for the differences in position, orientation and scaling. Our key contribution is a novel alignment-insensitive shape similarity (AISS) metric that tolerates misalignment of shapes while accounting for the differences in position, orientation and scaling. Together with the constrained deformation approach, we formulate the ASCII art generation as an optimization that minimizes shape dissimilarity and deformation. Convincing results and user study are shown to demonstrate its effectiveness.},
